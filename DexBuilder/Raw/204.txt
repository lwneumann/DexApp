Flavour Text




		Diamond
 
		It looks just like a pinecone. Its shell protects it from bird Pokémon that peck it by mistake.
		


Pearl


Platinum

 
HeartGold 
		It likes to make its shell thicker by adding layers of tree bark. The additional weight doesn't bother it.
		


SoulSilver

		It hangs and waits for flying insect prey to come near. It does not move about much on its own.
