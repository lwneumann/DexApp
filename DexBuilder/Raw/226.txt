To get Mantyke, you will need to breed while holding the Wave Incense





Flavour Text




		Diamond
 
		When the waves are calm, one may encounter a swarm of MANTINE swimming as if they are in flight.
		


Pearl
		

		It swims elegantly, mindless of REMORAID hitching on to its broad fins. It has a docile nature.
		
 
Platinum
		

		While elegantly swimming in the sea, it ignores REMORAID that cling to its fins seeking food scraps.
		
 
HeartGold 
		As it majestically swims, it doesn't care if REMORAID attach to it for scavenging its leftovers.
		


SoulSilver

		Swimming freely in open seas, it may fly out of the water and over the waves if it builds up enough speed.
