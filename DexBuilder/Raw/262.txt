Ability: Intimidate & Quick Feet 



Intimidate: Upon entering battle, the opponent’s Attack lowers one stage. In a Double Battle, both opponents’ Attack are lowered. Pokémon with the Clear Body, Hyper Cutter, or White Smoke ability are unaffected. In a link battle, if both sides switch on the same turn, and first player sends out a Pokémon with Intimidate, the opponent’s Attack will be lowered before the opponent’s Pokémon switches. 
Quick Feet: Speed is increased by 50% when induced with a status (Burn, Poison, Sleep, Frozen & Paralysis). If Paralysed, the speed drop is ignored.
