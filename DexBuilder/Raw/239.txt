Flavour Text




		Diamond
 
		It generates electricity by whirling its arms. However, it can't store the energy it makes.
		


Pearl


Platinum
		

		A weak electric current flows between its horns. Sticking a hand there shocks the unwary.
		  
HeartGold 
		It rotates its arms to generate electricity, but it tires easily, so it only charges up a little bit.
		


SoulSilver

		Even in the most vicious storm, this Pokémon plays happily if thunder rumbles in the sky.
