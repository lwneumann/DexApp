Flavour Text




		Diamond
 
		Because it is very proud, it hates accepting food from people. Its thick down guards it from cold.
		


Pearl
		

		It lives along shores in northern countries. A skilled swimmer, it dives for over 10 minutes to hunt.
		
 
Platinum
		

		A poor walker, it often falls down. However, its strong pride makes it puff up its chest without a care.
		
 
HeartGold 
		It doesn't like to be taken care of. It's difficult to bond with since it won't listen to its Trainer.
