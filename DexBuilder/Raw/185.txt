Pearl
		

		It stands along paths pretending to be a tree. If it starts raining, it seems to disappear.
		
 
Platinum
		

		To avoid being attacked, it does nothing but mimic a tree. It hates water and flees from rain.
		
 
HeartGold 
		Although it always pretends to be a tree, its composition appears more similar to rock than to vegetation.
		


SoulSilver

		It disguises itself as a tree to avoid attack. It hates water, so it will disappear if it starts raining.
