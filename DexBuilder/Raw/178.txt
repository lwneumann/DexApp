Ability: Synchronize & Early Bird 



Synchronize: When this Pokémon becomes POISON, PARALYZE, or BURN, so does the opponent. However, Fire-type and Water Veil ability Pokémon cannot be BURNed, Poison-type and Steel-type and Immunity ability Pokémon cannot be POISONed, and Limber ability Pokémon cannot be PARALYZEd. 
Early Bird: SLEEP conditions lasts for half as long, rounding down. For example, half of three turns is 1.5, which rounds down to one turn. When the number of turns to sleep is one, half of this rounded down is zero, and the Pokémon wakes up instantly.
