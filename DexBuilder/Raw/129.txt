Flavour Text




		Diamond
 
		It is said to be the world's weakest Pokťmon. No one knows why it has managed to survive.
		


Pearl
		

		It is unable to swim against even slow-moving currents. It always splashes about for some reason.
		
 
Platinum
		

		A MAGIKARP living for many years can leap a mountain using Splash. The move remains useless, though.
		
 
HeartGold 
		An underpowered, pathetic Pokťmon. It may jump high on rare occasions, but usually not more than seven feet.
		


SoulSilver

		For no reason, it jumps and splashes about, making it easy for predators like PIDGEOTTO to catch it mid-jump.
