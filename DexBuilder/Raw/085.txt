Ability: Run Away & Early Bird 



Run Away: Except for trainer battles, can always run from battle. Cannot run during Mean Look or Block or when the opponent is trapping with the Arena Trap, Magnet Pull, or Shadow Tag ability. 
Early Bird: SLEEP conditions lasts for half as long, rounding down. For example, half of three turns is 1.5, which rounds down to one turn. When the number of turns to sleep is one, half of this rounded down is zero, and the Pokémon wakes up instantly.

Flavour Text




		Diamond
 
		When DODUO evolves into this odd breed, one of its heads splits into two. It runs at nearly 40 mph.
		


Pearl


Platinum

 
HeartGold 
		It collects data and plans three times as wisely, but it may think too much and fall into a state of immobility.
		


SoulSilver

		If one of the heads gets to eat, the others will be satisfied, too, and they will stop squabbling.
